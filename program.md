# Program

## General Organization
Lectures will combine theoretical content with practical applications.  
Students will attend lectures and practice with the presented concepts by implementing and showcasing prototypes.  
Students can also present their work (e.g., as posters or talks).

## Topic: Testing and Verification of DNN-based Systems
We will bring together experts on software testing, validation, and verification from the following communities:  
*Software Engineering, Software Quality and Testing, Falsification and Runtime Verification, Autonomous Systems, and Formal Methods (with focus on Verification of ML/DNN).*

### Covered topics include:
- Foundations of AI and DNN Systems (Architectures, training processes, vulnerabilities)
- Testing Techniques for DNNs (Falsification, Search-based testing, Fuzzing, Causality-driven test generation, etc.)
- Formal Verification of AI Models (Techniques for formally verifying properties and hyper-properties of DNNs, such as safety and fairness)
- Runtime Monitoring of Hyper-Properties
- Explainability and Robustness
- Application of DNN-enabled systems in specific domains (e.g., Autonomous Vehicles, Drones, Robotics)
